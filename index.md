## HU Data Science Pool

### Our Mission
The Data Science Pool (*DSP*) team was created in December 2022 in order to support the *HU community* at large in Data Science related projects.
Our goal is to serve Researchers, Students, Professors and workers at HU; our team is growing and we expect to add more services and areas with time, in this starting phase we are focusing on our core skill-set: Data Science.

### Data Science
What can the *HU community* expect from the DSP team?

Data Science has many flavors, [this one](https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-science), [that one](https://www.oracle.com/uk/what-is-data-science/) and [so on](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/data-science/); at the *DSP* we like the following defintion from [*IBM*](https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-science):

*Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organizationâ€™s data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.* 

We are eager to *uncover actionable insights* in data in general and Data Science is a collection of tools that help us finding those insights. As a supporting team, our main goal is not to develop fundamental research, but rather enable researchers and other interested members of the *HU community* to *get things done* when it comes to Data Science.  


### Core Support
- Data Science
    - Data gathering - What data do I need?
    - Data Exploration and Analysis - What's inside my data?
    - Machine Learning - Can I learn from this data and use that knowledge to my advantage?
    - From an idea to a solution - How to get from A to B?
    - And more
  
### Other Areas 
We are a diverse team, with different skills and interests, so we might be able to help with other interesting areas, you can always ask!
Among others we like:
- Scientific Software Development
- High Performance Computing
- Computer Modeling
- Computer Vision
- etc.

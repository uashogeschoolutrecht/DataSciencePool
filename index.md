## HU Data Science Pool

The Data Science Pool (DSP) team was created in December 2022 in order to support the HU community at large in Data Science related projects.
Our goal is to serve Researchers, Students, Professors and workers at HU; our team is growing and we expect to add more services and areas with time, in this starting phase we are focusing on our core skill set Data Science:

### Data Science
- Data Science
    - Data Analysis
    - Machine Learning
    - Statistics
    - From an idea to a solution 
    - And more
    
### Other Areas 
We are a diverse team, with different skills and interests, so we might be able to help with other interesting areas, you can always ask!

< Note: I would like to keep these areas low key right now in order to avoid unwanted clashes with other teams at HU that offer similar support >

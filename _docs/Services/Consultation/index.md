## Short consultation

Sometimes in order to go forward, you just need to clear some doubt or maybe you have a question about your tools or your data. 

At the Data Science Pool we can help you!

Every week we dedicate some hours to attend to questions from the HU community; there are no silly questions and everybody is welcome. This works in a similar fashion to the *inloopspreekuur* at your doctor's, you come in and we try to help you to the best of our skills, if we do not know the answer, we will think along with you about where you can get the answer that you are looking for.

We are in the process of finding a physical location in the HU campus, where people can reach us; in the meantime you can drop us an email at <datasciencepool@hu.nl> and we will respond as soon as possible.

## Our services

We strive to support the *HU community* in a broad sense, this means we are available for everyone at the most of our capacity; in order to be effective in assisting while keeping the quality.

As a starting point, we propose the following scheme in order to consitently receive and process any requests for support:

We follow this scheme, so that everyone gets the same attention in our HU community; we are open to hear from you, do not hesitate to contact us, even if you think your question or project does not fully fit in our scheme, there is always space to discuss and improve!

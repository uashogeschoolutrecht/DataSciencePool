## Long Term Projects

Some projects are simply more convoluted and require much more than a couple of weeks to develop; for these type of projects the Data Science Pool (DSP) provides budgeted support. The project is assessed in terms of effort / risk, we manage expectations from the beginning and communicate with our *customers* transparently. 
In this category of projects you can think of:

- Creating a model to classify human activities to support physiotherapists in practical settings
- Data exploration, cleaning and processing
- Support in the technical aspects for grant proposals

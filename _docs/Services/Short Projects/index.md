## Short Projects

We offer step-by-step support to our *customers* for short projects, where in a few weeks time we can help you in a variety of ways, for example:

- Your algorithms are too complex to run on your laptop?
- Exploring data so that you can make the most of it (data cleaning, feature engineering, etc.)
- Evaluating a couple of Machine Learning models on clean data, to find the one that fits best to your needs (no pun intended)
- Making data [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)

Financing information is not included because this might bias people's questions/projects; the duration of projects should be based entirely in the objective estimation of effort/risks by the DSP. This of course will be communicated timely to the researcher/aanvrager.

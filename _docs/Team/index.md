## Team Scope and Collaboration

Our team has a very well defined task of supporting researchers and other members of the HU comunity in **Data Science** problems. 

We thrive in having a clear scope for our work, in other words: what can our team help you with and what is outside our reach. 

Having a clear scope for our team creates infinite opportunities for collaboration with other teams: if a project or question does not fall within our scope we can help you indicating the right team for it!

The following scheme shows our *scope* and our *interfaces* (this is how we connect with other teams):

In at least one project, we already collaborate with other teams in specific tasks where their skills better match the researcher needs; our end goal is to be a working part of the research support ecosystem that HU has in place to support the community.

## Our enablers

As a support team, we support ourselves on other teams and members of the HU community, our *enablers*; these enablers, allow us to connect nicely with the modern infrastructure that HU has in place to serve its community. 
In particular we collaborate closely with **Margreet Riphagen**, **Rins Rutgers** and **Tineke van der Meer** from the *Digitale onderzoeksomgeving*, they support our efforts in *Infrastructure and Cloud* and *Data Stewardship* related questions. We also receive support from **Klaske de Hoop** and **Fraukje Coopmans** from the *Data & Analytics* team. Finally we also keep close contact with other members of the community that have been involved in the effort of making the DSP a reality, such as **Marc Teunis**, **Saskia te Velde** and **Henri Kiers**.

## Team Scope and Collaboration

Our team has a very well defined task of supporting researchers and other members of the HU comunity in **Data Science** problems. 

We thrive in having a clear scope for our work, in other words: what can our team help you with and what is outside our reach. 

Having a clear scope for our team creates infinite opportunities for collaboration with other teams: if a project or question does not fall within our scope we can help you indicating the right team for it!

The following scheme shows our *scope* and our *interfaces* (this is how we connect with other teams):

In at least one project, we already collaborate with other teams in specific tasks where their skills better match the researcher needs; our end goal is to be a working part of the research support ecosystem that HU has in place to support the community.

In particular we collaborate closely with **Rins Rutgers** and the *Digitale onderzoeksomgeving*, they support our efforts in *Infrastructure and Cloud* related questions.

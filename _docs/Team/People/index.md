I am Xiaowen Song. I come from China. After graduating from bachelor in Computer Science and Technology. I came to the Netherland in 2018. I finished my Master in University of Twente, specialized in Data Science and Technology. During my master, I did both my internship and final thesis in Movella. I applied for a patent for my final thesis: A Method for Imputation of Missing Sensor Data in Motion Tracking. I joined Movella as a Jr. Machine Learning Scientist from October, 2020. My job is to integrate machine learning solutions for health and sports applications.  For instance, the applications can be human activity recognition,  auto sensor-segment labeling, missing data imputation, etc. University of Twente, Master of Data Science and Technology

Summary skills and experience:
- Machine Learning. (Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, Pytorch)
- Data Mining and Visualization. (WEKA, Tableau)
- Human motion tracking. (Experience in analyzing human motions, human activity recognition, missing data imputation, etc.)

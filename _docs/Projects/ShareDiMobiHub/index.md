## ShareDiMobiHub - Shared and Digital Mobility Hubs


**Dates: 01/02/2023**

**Type of project: Long Term Project**

**Stage: Starting phase**

**HU request by: Pascal Ravesteijn - Lectoraat Procesinnovatie & informatiesystemen**

The ShareDiMobiHub project tries to answer several questions regarding mobility at both local and regional scales; it involves a group of international partners including the University of Applied Sciences - Utrecht and the Province of Utrecht.

The final aim is to improve the multi-modal accessibility by increasing and improving the way shared mobility hubs are introduced in urban areas. The hub is to create the right conditions that result in a shift in behaviors towards shared mobility hubs.

Very interesting questions arise for this project:
- What is the present status of shared mobility hubs and what can we learn about it?
- How to define a successful shared mobility hub and what metrics to use?
- How to optimize *location* of shared mobility hubs in terms of those metrics?
- How to use and present data from shared mobility hubs, in order to provide better decision support?
- How to measure impact from the social, economic and environmental point of view?

The Data Science Pool (DSP) team, provides support in different areas: data sourcing (what data?), data combination, data presentation and monitoring (dashboard), metrics development, etc.

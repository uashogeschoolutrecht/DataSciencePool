## Hoe Veel Beweeg Jij - Tracking Movement in Kids

**Dates: 02/2022**

**Type of project: Short Consultation**

**Stage: To be started**

**HU request by: Barbara Engels - Lectoraat Leefstijl en Gezondheid**

Movement is a very important part of a kid's development, therefore impairments or limitations in the movement could have severe consequences in children development.
For children Physiotherapists then, it would be very helpful to have a way to measure and track the movement of a kid; this comes with several challenges to be addressed:

- *Usability*: children are children and a sensor needs to be "invisible" to them in order for it to be effective, so where to locate a sensor?
- *Age groups*: children at different ages have very different activities, how to account for that? How generic can a model be?

Here the Data Science Pool (DSP) team will support the researcher in addressing these questions by looking at the data and providing sensible answers that allow the researcher to plan and pursue further developments in the future.

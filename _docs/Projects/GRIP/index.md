## GRIP - Activity Patterns Study to Help People with Chronic Pain


**Dates: 01/12/2022 - Present**

**Type of project: Long Term Project**

**Stage: Started**

**HU request by: Harriet Wittink - Lectoraat Leefstijl en Gezondheid**

The GRIP (beweeGsensoren voor mensen met chRonIsche Pijn) project, aims to use movement sensors (accelerometers) in order to model the complex activity patterns of people with Chronic Pain (CP). 
Several challenges arise in this project, for example lack of enough labeled data that allows for a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm to properly learn about the activity patterns of people with CP. 
Preliminary results on open source datasets suggest that there are ways to tackle those challenges

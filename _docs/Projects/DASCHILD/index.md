## DASCHILD - Developing inclusive Automatic Speech recognition for Dutch CHILDren


**Dates: Not yet defined**

**Type of project: Short Consultation (temporarily)**

**Stage: Preproposal**

**HU request by: Johan Versendaal - Lectoraat Betekenisvol Digitaal Innoveren**

Nowadays is typical for children to interface with technology throughout their day; Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) enables many of those interactions: "Hey Google, play *Encanto*", from playing Disney movies to educational settings, ASR is present in many children's lifes. 
ASR technologies, although quite mature, depend still on a relatively low heterogeneity of speech; DASCHILD seeks to pioneer an inclusive child ASR where highly heterogeneous children speech types are included.

The Data Science Pool (DSP) team, is supporting this effort intially as a Short Consultation, providing expertise in the field of ASR; our aim is to support the HU researchers involved in this consortium in order to have an up-to-date view of technical developments and challenges of ASR systems.
